You can change the name by opening the dropdown menu and writing inside the corresponding box.  Then all properties will be available as <code>DynLeaderboardsPlugin.&lt;chosen name&gt;.&lt;pos&gt;.&lt;property name&gt;</code>.  For example you named your dynamic leaderboard as \"MyDynLeaderboard\" then you can do  <code>DynLeaderboardsPlugin.MyDynLeaderboard.5.Car.Number</code> to get the fifth car's number in whatever leaderboard type is currently.  If it's overall order you get the fifth car overall, if it's on track relative leaderboard you get the car that is in  fifth position in that order.</p> <p>Next you need to set the leaderboards rotation and which ones you even want to see in your rotation.  Check the toggle buttons and move leaderboards up and down.  If there are unchecked leaderboards are simply ignored, doesn't matter in which location they are.</p> <p>Next section provides an option to set number of positions exported as properties.  The actual number of car's exported is the maximum positions needed for any leaderboard.  For relative leaderboards you set the number of cars shown ahead and behind the focused car.  Drivers are ordered such that the current driver is always the first one and if you set number of drivers to 1,  we only export current driver.  Note that you can set any of the properties to 0 to not export them.</p> <p>Then scroll through the properties and select all of the ones you want.  For dynamic leaderboard I recommend to use <code>...Gaps.Dynamic...</code> and <code>...Delta.Dynamic...</code> properties which change  according to the currently selected leaderboard. This way you don't need to switch between the gaps and lap deltas yourself.</p> <p>Final configuration step is to go to the \"Controls and events\" from SimHub sidebar and add mappings  for <code>DynLeaderboardsPlugin.&lt;name&gt;.NextLeaderboard</code> and <code>DynLeaderboardsPlugin.&lt;name&gt;.PreviousLeaderboard</code> actions.  As stated above for mapping to controller inputs you need to enable \"Controllers input\" plugin and to keyboard inputs  \"Keyboard Input\" plugin.</p> <p>Now restart SimHub and start create your dashboard.

Do not edit the files in "base" folder or your changes may be lost.

An update to the DynLeaderboards plugin may update the files in "base" and overwrite your changes.

An user edited files should be in the "overrides" folder.
Both folders follow exact same structure.
You can use the config files from "base" folder as a base for your edits
but you should delete all options that you don't want to override.

All suggestions and requests are welcome regarding the plugin [^1]. 
As with [issues](troubleshooting.md#issues) the preferred location for them is [GitHub issues] but [discussion thread on OverTake forums] works fine as well.

For existing ideas/requests/suggestions you can also look at the [project board](https://github.com/users/kaiusl/projects/2) where we have been collecting all kinds of ideas that could be added.
Anything under "Accepted" tab we would like to add but "Pending" tab is more in the air. 
If you would like to see any of the ideas from there realized open up a request and we'll see what can be done.


[^1]: Most likely we won't be accepting suggestions or requests related to the dashboard provided with this plugin.
It is meant as an example on how to use the "Dynamic Leaderboards Plugin" and maybe provide a base for your own dashboard.
Any more complete and polished dashboards will be provided separately.

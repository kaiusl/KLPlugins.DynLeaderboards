## Issues

#### Known

None at the moment.

#### Other

In case you find other issues, feel free to report them. 
If at all possible I'd prefer issues to be reported on [GitHub], just to keep them clean and all in one place. 
If that's not possible the [discussion thread on OverTake forums] is fine as well.

Before reporting check through existing [issues] and [discussion thread on OverTake forums] for similar issues.
Maybe it has already been reported or even better has some solution.

When reporting issues, please include as much information as possible. 
This will help to solve any issues faster. 
That information includes:

* Game and session info (SP or MP, practice/race etc).
* SimHub, plugin and game versions.
* SimHub log files from {{ path("../SimHub/Logs") }} (usually it's best to zip all of them together)
    * Basic logging information should show most direct errors 
      however more information is logged by turning on `Log` option in the plugin settings menu. 
      If possible you could turn that on and try to reproduce the issue with it.
* A SimHub replay displaying the issue.
* A screenshot displaying the issue.
* The dashboard where issue appeared (if it's not provided by this plugin).
